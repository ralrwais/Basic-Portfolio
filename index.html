			<h1> About Me </h1>
			<p>Hello, and welcome to my page. My name is Rima Alrwais and I am a young creative living and working in San Francisco. I am a very outgoing person, and there is rarely anything I wouldnt try once. One of my biggest passions is travel, I have visited 15 countries and counting. 


			Among other things like writing, singing, playing music and making short films, I develop web pages. I draw inspiration from everyday life and other people, as well as my imagination and dreams for the future. This site is here to introduce you to my work and give you an idea of who I am as a person. Enjoy! 
			</p>
