				<img id="Me" src="pic of me">

				<p>Hello, and welcome to my page. My name is Rima Alrwais and I am a young creative living and working in San Francisco. I am a very outgoing person, and there is rarely anything I wouldnt try once. One of my biggest passions is travel, I have visited 15 countries and counting. 

					<br>	
					<br>
					<br>
				Among other things like writing, singing, playing music and making short films, I develop web pages. This site is here to introduce you to my work and give you an idea of who I am as a person. Enjoy!
